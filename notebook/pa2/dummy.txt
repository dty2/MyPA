make ARCH=$ISA-nemu ALL=dummy run
when I got there, I didn't really understand the meaning of command, so I chose copy and paste directly, then guess what? I got the error.
The ISA need be replace to your own ISA, like riscv32. And I don't realize it

well, if you chose the riscv32 as your own ISA, you will meet the error again.
Don't worry, the solution is in tutorial.
The error which I meet is 
/usr/riscv64-linux-gnu/include/gnu/stubs.h:8:11: fatal error: gnu/stubs-ilp32.h: No such file or directory
Just follow the tutorial, it tell you how to solve it.
Maybe you can't understand what to do before you saw the solution which it told.
Just relex, - means remove something, and + means add something.
So, you only need to add "//" before #include <gnu/stubs-ilp32.h>.
